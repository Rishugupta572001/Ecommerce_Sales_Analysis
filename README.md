Ecommerce Sales Analysis Report

Overview
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of ecommerce sales data using Excel. The purpose of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights, identify sales trends, and create a visually compelling dashboard that presents key metrics for quick decision-making.

Project Details
The data was collected from an ecommerce platform, where it was stored in raw format with multiple fields representing transaction details. The project involved cleaning the raw data, performing data analysis using Excel functions, creating a pivot table, and developing a dashboard for interactive visualizations.

Steps Taken
1. Data Cleaning
The raw dataset initially contained inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicate records, and formatting issues. The following data-cleaning steps were performed:

Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.
Filled or removed missing values to prevent analysis errors.
Standardized date formats for consistency.
Formatted numerical columns (like price and quantity) for accurate calculations.
2. Data Analysis
To uncover patterns and generate actionable insights, I used Excel functions to perform calculations and summaries on the data:

SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, and other basic functions to derive key statistics.
IF and VLOOKUP functions to categorize data and match information across sheets.
Date functions (e.g., YEAR, MONTH) to analyze seasonal trends.
3. Pivot Table
A pivot table was created to summarize and aggregate the data, allowing me to:

Analyze sales by month, product, and region.
Identify top-selling products and high-performing sales regions.
Calculate total revenue and average order values.
4. Dashboard Creation
Using the insights from the pivot table, I developed an interactive dashboard to present the findings in a clear, visually engaging manner. The dashboard includes:

Monthly sales trends to show how sales vary over time.
Product-wise sales distribution to highlight best-selling items.
Geographical sales overview to indicate high-performing regions.
Revenue and order volume summaries to provide quick insights into overall performance.
The dashboard is designed for easy navigation and provides key metrics at a glance, making it valuable for stakeholders interested in tracking and improving ecommerce performance.

Conclusion
This Ecommerce Sales Analysis report provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, which can be leveraged by ecommerce teams to make data-driven decisions. By sharing this project on GitHub and LinkedIn, I aim to demonstrate my ability to work with raw data, perform analysis, and create insightful visualizations that support business goals.
